**_Abstract_**:
*Privacy of our personal data stored in clouds is under constant threat. 
Data from our activities online and even offline are being stored, processed and mined to generate valuable information for commercial interests. 
While this is being done, the individuals have very little or no knowledge about the sub-processors accessing their data. 
The lack of strict regulations has allowed commercial interests to disregard the privacy of users. 
A growing distrust among users about storing their personal data in the cloud has created the need for privacy preserving systems. 
In this direction, we present Tolla, a data management system for personal data. 
Tolla gives user total control over their data along with granular privacy controls to enable legacy internet services.*
